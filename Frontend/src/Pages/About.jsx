        <Text>
          CodeFlow is the brainchild of a team of passionate developers who came
          together during a Construct Week, a dedicated period for intensive
          collaboration and innovation. Fueled by a shared vision to create a
          cutting-edge collaborative coding platform, our journey began with a
          commitment to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of
          coding.
